# Project Status (as of June 29, 2025)

## Completed

- User authentication (Clerk)
- Basic habit management (CRUD, streaks)
- Friends system (add, accept/decline, remove) with modular UI and sidebar navigation
- Cheers system (send, receive, restrictions) using UI primitives
- Sidebar navigation for Habits and Friends
- Modular UI for Friends and Habits (components/friends, components/habits)
- All feature UIs (Habits, Friends, Cheers, Sidebar, etc.) use atomic UI primitives from `components/ui/` for consistency, accessibility, and cursor rules
- Responsive UI, dark mode
- tRPC API and Prisma ORM backend
- Toast notifications and tooltips are used for all user feedback and error handling.
- CI/CD and test integration:
  - GitHub Actions workflows run lint, unit, and E2E tests (Vitest, Playwright) on PRs and deploys.
  - Test steps are conditional on the presence of test files for efficiency.

## In Progress

- Dashboard redesign (sidebar/topbar, analytics, habit cards)
- AI-powered features (habit suggestions, motivational messages)
- Advanced analytics (graphs, badges, mood tracking)
- Notification UI (panel, bell, display logic)

## Planned

- AI-driven adaptive reminders and predictive nudges
- Social accountability matching (habit buddies)
- Integration with calendar/weather APIs
- Enhanced gamification (more badges, rewards)
- Ongoing improvements to modularity and maintainability
